.SH NAME
pdfjam \- A shell script for manipulating PDF files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pdfjam
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,--\/\fR] [\fI\,file\/\fR[\fI\,pages\/\fR]]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
pdfjam assembles a list of documents (pdf, jpg or png) into a single pdf.
It allows to rotate, scale, reorder and combine pages freely
using the power of the 'pdfpages' and 'graphicx' LaTeX packages; see
https://www.ctan.org/tex\-archive/macros/latex/contrib/pdfpages
https://www.ctan.org/tex\-archive/macros/latex/contrib/graphicx
.PP
Output is written to a generated name (unless specified via \fB\-\-outfile\fR).
The input files are embedded as graphics in the output. Especially jpg files
are kept as is without transcoding. Input from stdin is supported by specifying
\fI\,/dev/stdin\/\fP as a file and is the default if no file is given.
.PP
By specifying \fI\,pages\/\fP it is possible to specfiy which pages to include
in which order.  The default '\-' selects all pages.  An example:
.IP
pdfjam file1 '{},2,4\-6,9\-' ...
.PP
makes an empty page, followed by pages 2,4,5,6 of file1, followed by pages
9 onwards (up to the end of file1).
.PP
A page selection can be applied to more than one file, e.g.,
.IP
pdfjam file1 file2 file3 last\-1 ...
.PP
applies page selection 'last\-1' (reverting the page order) to all three files; but for example
.IP
pdfjam file1 file2 2\- file3 1\-7 ...
.PP
would apply the page selection '2\-' to file1 and file2, and '1\-7' to file3.
A page selection applies to all the files *immediately* preceding it in the
argument list.
.PP
See the pdfpages manual for more details on pagespec syntax.
.SH OPTIONS TO PDFPAGES AND GRAHPICX
Key value options to 'pdfpages' and 'graphicx' can be specified as \fI\,\-\-key value\,\fP.
.SH META OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Output this text only; no processing of PDF files.
.TP
\fB\-\-configpath\fR
Output the 'configpath' variable and exit immediately; no processing of PDF files.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Output the version number of pdfjam and exit immediately; no
processing of PDF files.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Suppress verbose commentary on progress.
.SH PROCESSING OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-batch\fR
Run pdfjam sequentially on each input file in turn, and produce a separate
output file for each input, rather than the default coalescing behaviour.  For
the location of output files, see \fB\-\-outfile\fR.  The \fB\-\-batch\fR option
cannot be used in the case of input from stdin.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-outfile\fR name
Specifies where the output file(s) will go. If 'name' is an existing directory,
pdfjam will attempt to write its output PDF file(s) there, with name(s) derived
from the input file name(s) and the \fB\-\-suffix\fR option (see below).
Otherwise the output pdf will be written at 'name'.
Your current default PATH for output is:
\fI\,$outfile\/\fP
.TP
\fB\-\-suffix\fR string
Specifies a suffix for output file names, to be used when \fB\-\-outfile\fR is
unspecified or a directory.  The STRING must not have zero length.
[Default for you at this site: suffix=$suffix]
.TP
\fB\-\-checkfiles\fR, \fB\-\-no\-checkfiles\fR
If the Unix 'file' utility is available, the output of 'file \fB\-Lb\fR FILE1'
should be 'PDF document...' where '...' gives version information.  If this is
the case on your system you should use \fB\-\-checkfiles\fR; otherwise use
\fB\-\-no\-checkfiles\fR, in which case all input files must have the correct
extensions (.pdf, .PDF, .jpg, .JPG, .png or .PNG).
[Default for you at this site: checkfiles=$checkfiles]
.TP
\fB\-\-latex\fR pathtolatex
Specify the LaTeX engine to be used (one of pdflatex,
xelatex, lualatex).  The pathtolatex string must be
the full path to a suitable LaTeX executable (for example
\fI\,/usr/bin/xelatex\/\fP on many unix systems).
[Default for you at this site: latex=$latex]
.TP
\fB\-\-tidy\fR, \fB\-\-no\-tidy\fR
Specify whether the temporary directory created by pdfjam should be deleted.
Use '\-\-no\-tidy' or '\-\-build\-dir' (see below) to help debug most errors.
[Default for you at this site: tidy=$tidy]
.TP
\fB\-\-build\-dir\fR path
Specifies a build directory to be used in place of a temporary one. Existing
files inside will be overwritten. Overrides \fB\-\-tidy\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-runs\fR N
Run latex N times, for each output document made.
[Default for you at this site: runs=$runs]
.TP
\fB\-\-vanilla\fR
Suppress the reading of any pdfjam configuration files.
.TP
\fB\-\-enc\fR
Specify a command\-line encoding
[Default for you at this site: enc=$enc]
.SH PAPER OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-paper\fR papername, \fB\-\-papername\fR
.IP
Specify a LaTeX paper size, for example '\-\-paper a4' or simply '\-\-a4paper'
for ISO A4 paper.  A wide range of paper sizes is available thanks to the
LaTeX 'geometry' package.  For details see documentation
for LaTeX and/or the 'geometry' package.  If no default value is set, obtain
the systemâ€™s default paper via libpaper, falling back to A4.
[Default for you at this site: paper=$paper]
.TP
\fB\-\-papersize\fR width,height
Specify a custom paper size in points = 1/72 inch (known as bp in LaTeX and as
pt in other software), e.g. \fB\-\-papersize\fR 612,792.
Units may also be specified explicitly, e.g. \fB\-\-papersize\fR 10in,18cm.
[Libpaper default: $papersize]
.TP
\fB\-\-landscape\fR, \fB\-\-no\-landscape\fR
Specify landscape page orientation (or not) in the output PDF file.
[Default for you at this site: landscape=$landscape]
.TP
\fB\-\-twoside\fR, \fB\-\-no\-twoside\fR
Specify (or not) the 'twoside' document class option.
[Default for you at this site: twoside=$twoside]
.TP
\fB\-\-other\-edge\fR, \fB\-\-no\-other\-edge\fR
Rotate every odd page by 180 degrees (or not).
Thus changes along which edge the pages are flipped in duplex printing.
.TP
\fB\-\-pagecolor\fR rgbspec
Specify a background colour for the output pages.  The RGBSPEC must be a
comma\-separated triple of integers between 0 and 255.  An example:
\fB\-\-pagecolor\fR 150,200,150
[Default is no background colour]
.SH PDFINFO OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-keepinfo\fR, \fB\-\-no\-keepinfo\fR
Preserve (or not) Title, Author, Subject and Keywords
(from the last input PDF file, if more than one) in the
output PDF file.  This requires the pdfinfo utility, from
the poppler-utils package, and the LaTeX 'hyperref' package; if
either of those is not available, '\-\-keepinfo' is ignored.
[Default for you at this site: keepinfo=$keepinfo]
.TP
\fB\-\-pdftitle\fR string, \fB\-\-pdfauthor\fR string, \fB\-\-pdfsubject\fR string, \fB\-\-pdfkeywords\fR string
Provide text for the Title, Author, Subject and Keywords in the output PDF
file.  Requires the LaTeX 'hyperref' package.  These options, individually,
override \fB\-\-keepinfo\fR.
.SH ADVANCED OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-preamble\fR string
Append the supplied STRING to the preamble of the LaTeX
source file(s), immediately before the '\ebegin{document}'
line to load LaTeX packages or set global options.  An example:
.IP
pdfjam \fB\-\-nup\fR 2x2 myfile.pdf \fB\-o\fR myfile\-4up.pdf \e
\fB\-\-preamble\fR '\eusepackage{fancyhdr} \epagestyle{fancy}'
.PP
If '\-\-preamble' is used more than once in the call, the supplied preamble
strings are concatenated.  For a note on avoiding clashes, see the README file,
also available at $repository.
.TP
.TP
\fB\-\-\fR
Signals end of options processing.
.SH PDFPAGES AND GRAPHICX OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-KEY\fR VALUE
Specify options to '\eincludepdfmerge', in the LaTeX 'pdfpages' package.  See
the the pdfpages documentation (usually 'texdoc pdfpages') for more
information.  Here KEY is the name of any of the many options
for '\eincludepdfmerge', and VALUE is a corresponding value.
Examples:
.IP
\fB\-\-nup\fR 2x1
(for 2\-up side\-by\-side imposition)
.IP
\fB\-\-scale\fR 0.7
(to scale all input pages to 70% size)
.IP
\fB\-\-offset\fR '1cm 0.5cm'
(to offset all pages \fB\-\-\fR note the quotes!)
.IP
\fB\-\-frame\fR true
(to put a frame round each input page)
.IP
\fB\-\-booklet\fR true (to reorder the pages in signatures,
generally useful with \fB\-\-nup\fR)
.IP
\fB\-\-signature\fR N (specify the signature size, as the number of original
pages in a signature in the final document. Caveat: booklet is a short form for
signature, so if you use booklet true, signature will be ignored)
.IP
\fB\-\-trim\fR '1cm 2cm 1cm 2cm' \fB\-\-clip\fR true
(to trim those amounts from left, bottom, right and top, respectively, of input
pages)
.IP
\fB\-\-angle\fR NNN (The angle of rotation in degrees. Angles that are not
either 90, 180 or 270 will still create straight rectangular pages, only the
content will be rotated.)
.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
Defaults for the options
\fB\-\-suffix\fR,
\fB\-\-keepinfo\fR,

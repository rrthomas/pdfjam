pdfjam is a shell-script front end to the LaTeX 'pdfpages' package; see
https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/pdfpages

Usage: pdfjam [OPTIONS] [--] [FILE1 [SEL1]] [FILE2 [SEL2]]...

'FILE1' etc. are PDF files (JPG and PNG files are also allowed).  For
input from /dev/stdin, use the special name '/dev/stdin' in place of any
of FILE1, FILE2, etc: this can be mixed with 'real' files as needed, to
allow input through a pipe (note that if /dev/stdin is connected to tty,
an error results).  If 'FILE1' is absent, pdfjam will use '/dev/stdin'
(and will use '-' for the page selection -- see next item).

'SEL1' is a page selection for FILE1, etc.
To select all pages (the default) use '-'.  See the pdfpages manual for
more details.  An example:
    ... file1 '{},2,4-6,9-' ...
makes an empty page, followed by pages 2,4,5,6 of file1, followed by pages
9 onwards (up to the end of file1).
A page selection can be applied to more than one file, e.g.,
    ... file1 file2 file3 1-7 ...
applies page selection '1-7' to all three files; but for example
    ... file1 file2 2- file3 1-7 ...
would apply the page selection '2-' to file1 and file2, and '1-7'
to file3.  A page selection applies to all the files *immediately*
preceding it in the argument list.  A missing page selection defaults to
'-'; this includes the case where 'FILE1' is absent and so /dev/stdin gets
used by default.

'options' are pdfpages specifications in the form '--KEY VALUE' (see below), or any of the following.

  -h, --help
               Output this text only; no processing of PDF files.
  --configpath
               Output the 'configpath' variable and exit immediately; no
               processing of PDF files.
  -V, --version
               Output the version number of pdfjam and exit immediately; no
               processing of PDF files.
  -q, --quiet
               Suppress verbose commentary on progress.
  --batch
               Run pdfjam sequentially on each input file in turn, and
               produce a separate output file for each input, rather
               than the default behaviour (which is a single run of
               pdfjam on all of the input files, producing a single
               output document).  For the location of output
               files, see '--outfile'.  The --batch option cannot be
               used in the case of input from stdin.
  -o, --outfile PATH
               Specifies where the output file(s) will go.  If PATH is an
               existing directory, pdfjam will attempt to write its
               output PDF file(s) there, with name(s) derived from the
               input file name(s) and the --suffix option (see below).
               Otherwise the output file will be PATH.  If '/dev/stdin'
               is the only or last input file, PATH cannot be a directory.
               Your current default PATH for output is:
               $outFile
  --suffix STRING
               Specifies a suffix for output file names, to be used when
               --outfile is either (a) a directory, or
                                   (b) not specified in a --batch call.
               A good STRING should be descriptive: for example,
                        --suffix 'rotated'
               would append the text '-rotated' to the name of the input
               file in order to make the output file name, as in
               'myfile-rotated.pdf'.  The STRING must not have zero
               length.
               [Default for you at this site: suffix=$suffix]
  --checkfiles, --no-checkfiles
               If the Unix 'file' utility is available, with options
               -L and -b, the output of 'file -Lb FILE1' should be
               'PDF document...' where '...' gives version information.
               If this is the case on your system you should use
               '--checkfiles'; otherwise use '--no-checkfiles',
               in which case all input PDF files must have .pdf or .PDF
               as their name extension.
               [Default for you at this site: checkfiles=$checkfiles]
  --preamble STRING
               Append the supplied STRING to the preamble of the LaTeX
               source file(s), immediately before the '\begin{document}'
               line.  An example:
                   pdfjam --nup 2x2 myfile.pdf -o myfile-4up.pdf \\
                       --preamble '\usepackage{fancyhdr} \pagestyle{fancy}'
               The '--preamble' option can be used, for example, to load
               LaTeX packages and/or to set global options.  If '--preamble'
               is used more than once in the call, the supplied preamble
               strings are simply concatenated.  For a note on avoiding
               clashes, see the README file, also available at
               https://github.com/rrthomas/pdfjam
  --keepinfo, --no-keepinfo
               Preserve (or not) Title, Author, Subject and Keywords
               (from the last input PDF file, if more than one) in the
               output PDF file.  This requires the pdfinfo utility, from
               the xpdf package, and the LaTeX 'hyperref' package; if
               either of those is not available, '--keepinfo' is ignored.
               [Default for you at this site: keepinfo=$keepinfo]
  --pdftitle STRING
  --pdfauthor STRING
  --pdfsubject STRING
  --pdfkeywords STRING
               Provide text for the  Title, Author, Subject and Keywords
               in the output PDF file.  Requires the  LaTeX 'hyperref'
               package.  These options, individually, over-ride --keepinfo.
  --other-edge, --no-other-edge
               Rotate every odd page by 180 degrees (or not).  Thus changes
               along which edge the pages are flipped in duplex printing.
  --landscape, --no-landscape
               Specify landscape page orientation (or not) in the
               output PDF file.
               [Default for you at this site: landscape=$landscape]
  --twoside, --no-twoside
               Specify (or not) the 'twoside' document class option.
               [Default for you at this site: twoside=$twoside]
  --paper PAPERSPEC  (or simply --PAPERSPEC)
               Specify a LaTeX paper size, for example
               '--paper a4' or simply '--a4paper' for ISO A4 paper.
               A wide range of paper sizes is available thanks to the
               LaTeX 'geometry' package.  For details see documentation
               for LaTeX and/or the 'geometry' package.
               If no default value is set and libpaper is not available,
               A4 is used.
               [Default for you at this site: paper=$paper]
  --papersize WIDTH,HEIGHT
               Specify a custom paper size in points = 1/72 inch (known as
               bp in LaTeX and as pt in other software), e.g.
                   --papersize 612,792
               Units may also be specified explicitly, e.g.
                   --papersize 10in,18cm
               [Libpaper default: $papersize]
  --pagecolor RGBSPEC
               Specify a background colour for the output pages.  The
               RGBSPEC must be a comma-separated trio of integers
               between 0 and 255.  An example:
                      --pagecolor 150,200,150
               [Default is no background colour]
  --tidy, --no-tidy
               Specify whether the temporary directory created by
               pdfjam should be deleted.  Use '--no-tidy' or '--build-dir'
               below to help debug most errors.
               [Default for you at this site: tidy=$tidy]
  --build-dir PATH
               Specifies a build directory to be used in place of a
               temporary one. Existing files inside will be overwritten.
  --latex PATHTOLATEX
               Specify the LaTeX engine to be used (one of pdflatex,
               xelatex, lualatex).  The PATHTOLATEX string must be
               the full path to a suitable LaTeX executable (for example
               /usr/bin/xelatex on many unix systems).
               [Default for you at this site: latex=$latex]
  --runs N
               Run latex N times, for each output document made.
               [Default for you at this site: runs=$runs]
  --vanilla
               Suppress the reading of any pdfjam configuration files.
  --enc
               Specify a command-line encoding
               [Default for you at this site: enc=$enc]
  --KEY VALUE
               Specify options to '\includepdfmerge', in the LaTeX
               'pdfpages' package.  See the the pdfpages documentation
               (usually 'texdoc pdfpages') for more information.
               Here KEY is the name of any of the many options for
               '\includepdfmerge', and VALUE is a corresponding value.
               Examples:
                   --nup 2x1     (for 2-up side-by-side imposition)
                   --scale 0.7   (to scale all input pages to 70% size)
                   --offset '1cm 0.5cm'
                                 (to offset all pages -- note the quotes!)
                   --frame true  (to put a frame round each input page)
                   --booklet true (to reorder the pages in signatures,
                                   generally useful with --nup)
                   --signature N (specify the signature size, as the
                                  number of original pages in a signature
                                  in the final document. Caveat: booklet
                                  is a short form for signature, so if
                                  you use booklet true, signature will be
                                  ignored)
                   --trim '1cm 2cm 1cm 2cm' --clip true
                                 (to trim those amounts from left, bottom,
                                  right and top, respectively, of input
                                  pages)
                   --angle NNN (The angle of rotation in degrees. Angles
                                that are not either 90, 180 or 270 will
                                still create straight rectangular pages,
                                only the content will be rotated.)
               etc., etc.  For more information see the manual for
               the 'pdfpages' package, at
               https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/pdfpages
* '--' can be used to signal that there are no more options to come.

Defaults for the options '--suffix', '--keepinfo', '--paper', '--outfile',
'--landscape', '--twoside', '--tidy', '--latex', '--runs', '--checkfiles'
and '--preamble' can be set in site-wide or user-specific configuration files.
The path that is searched for site-wide configuration files (named pdfjam.conf)
at this installation is
    $configpath
This configuration path can be changed by editing the pdfjam script if
necessary.  Any user-specific configuration should be put in a file named
.pdfjam.conf in your home directory.  (All of these files are ignored
if the '--vanilla' argument is used.)

https://github.com/rrthomas/pdfjam.
